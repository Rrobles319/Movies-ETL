# Movies-ETL
The Movies-ETL repository contains refactored code from this module. We have refactored the code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
